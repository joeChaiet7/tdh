The Secure Platforms allow eligible Members to use Teladoc Services. All information collected and stored by Teladoc or added by our Members into such Secure Platforms is considered Protected Health Information ("PHI") and/or medical information and is governed by laws that apply to that information, for example the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

Teladoc has no control over and is not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the extent Teladoc does not own or control any linked websites or features you visit or use. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy practices of those third parties.

California residents should read the information available in Section 12 below about the categories of personal information to be collected from them and the purposes for which the personal information will be used.

#### 1. TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

While using our Websites, you may provide us with certain information about you. We or our advertising partners also may automatically collect information through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies (see below).

Personal Information that we collect through your use of the Websites may include IP Address, Device ID, and online identifier. We may use that Personal Information and link it to Internet or other electronic network activity information, and we may draw inferences about you from the information we collect. We may also collect your name, title, business contact information, phone number, date of birth, state, country, zip code, your health plan, email address or login identification information only if you provide such information directly to us when you begin registration to use a Secure Platform or complete a web form seeking more information. 

#### 2. HOW WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION

We may collect Personal Information using the following methods:

- Directly from you when you provide it to us (such as information you enter into web forms, inquiries, responses, activity on the Websites, and during registration to use a Secure Platform).

- From third parties, such as analytics and email marketing service providers.

- Automatically through tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons (also known as pixels) and log files, including over time and across third-party websites or other online services.

"Cookies" are small files that a website stores on a user's computer or device. The Websites may use cookies for various purposes, including to keep the information you enter on multiple pages together. Some of the cookies we use are "session" cookies, meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive after you close your browser at the end of your session. Session cookies are used to optimize performance of the Websites and to limit the amount of redundant data that is downloaded during a single session. We also may use "persistent" cookies, which remain on your computer or device unless deleted by you (or by your browser settings). We may use persistent cookies for various purposes, such as statistical analysis of performance to ensure the ongoing quality of our services. We and third parties may use session and persistent cookies for analytics and advertising purposes, as described herein. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may set your browser to block certain cookies (see below). In accordance with applicable law, we may obtain your consent separately before collecting information by automated means using cookies or similar devices.

Our Websites may use Google Analytics, a vendor's service that uses cookies, web beacons, web pixels and/or similar technology to collect and store anonymous information about you. You can learn more about Google Analytics' privacy policy and ways to opt out from Google Analytics tracking by visiting Google Analytics' website.

Our Websites may use Adobe's analytics and on-site personalization services, which use cookies, web beacons, web pixels and/or similar technology to collect and store information about you or your device or browser. You can learn more about how Adobe may handle information collected through our use of its services, and your options for controlling this activity, by visiting Adobe's website.

For more information about how we use Personal Information collected through tracking technologies and the ways you may be able to manage it, see below.

#### 3. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

We may use your Personal Information for the following purposes:

- Operate, maintain, supervise, administer, and enhance the Websites, including monitoring and analyzing the effectiveness of content on the Websites, aggregate site usage data, and other usage of the Websites such as checking your eligibility and assisting you in completing the registration process.

- Provide you with a tailored and user-friendly experience as you navigate our Websites.

- Promote and market our Websites to you.

- To complete the activity you specifically asked for, e.g., register on a Secure Platform, obtain more information, request a demo, or request an RFP.

- Conduct research on users' demographics, interests, and behavior based upon information provided during use of our Websites.

- Anonymize and aggregate information for analytics and reporting.

- Respond to law enforcement requests and court orders and legal process and carry out our legal and contractual obligations and enforce our rights.

- Authenticate use, detect potential fraudulent use, and otherwise maintain the security of the Websites and safety of users.

- Develop, test, improve, and demonstrate the Websites.

- Any other purpose with your consent.

#### 4. HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION

We may share Personal Information with third parties in certain circumstances or for certain purposes, including:

- ***For business purposes***. We may share your Personal Information with vendors and service providers, including our data hosting and data storage partners, analytics and advertising providers, technology services and support, and data security. We also may share Personal Information with professional advisors, such as auditors, law firms, and accounting firms. We may disclose your name, email address, date of birth, phone number, and address if you provided it to us via a form on the website or during an incomplete or failed registration to Service Providers.

- ***Compliance with law***. We may share your Personal Information to comply with applicable law or any obligations thereunder, including cooperation with law enforcement, judicial orders, and regulatory inquiries.

- ***In the context of a transaction***. We may share your Personal Information connection with an asset sale, merger, bankruptcy, or other business transaction.

- ***For other business reasons***. We may share your Personal Information to enforce any applicable Legal Disclaimer, and to ensure the safety and security of the Websites and/or our users.

- ***For advertising***. Using cookies and web beacons, we may disclose Personal Information regarding your activity on our Websites to our advertising partners to optimize marketing. The Personal Information we share for this purpose is limited to IP address, device ID, and online identifier. We do not share identifying information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any health information. 

We also may disclose deidentified information. Note that if you make any Personal Information publicly available on the Websites, anyone may see and use such information.

#### 5. SOCIAL FEATURES

Certain features of the Websites permit you to initiate interactions between the Websites and third-party services or platforms, such as social networks ("Social Features"). Social Features include features that allow you to click and access Teladoc's pages on certain third-party platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn as applicable, and from there to "like" or "share" our content on those platforms. Use of Social Features may entail a third party's collection and/or use of your data. If you use Social Features or similar third-party services, information you post or otherwise make accessible may be publicly displayed by the third-party service you are using. Both Teladoc and the third party may have access to information about you and your use of both the Websites and the third-party service.

#### 6. THIRD PARTY WEBSITES AND LINKS

Our Websites may contain links to other online platforms operated by third parties. We do not control such other online platforms and are not responsible for their content, their privacy policies, or their use of your information. Information you provide on public or semi-public venues, including information you share on third-party social networking platforms (such as Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter) may also be viewable by other users of the Websites and/or users of those third-party online platforms without limitation as to its use by us or by a third party. Our inclusion of such links does not, by itself, imply any endorsement of the content on such platforms or of their owners or operators except as disclosed on the Websites. We expressly disclaim any and all liability for the actions of third parties, including but without limitation to actions relating to the use and/or disclosure of Personal Information by third parties. Any information submitted by you directly to these third parties is subject to that third party's privacy policy.

#### 7. COOKIES AND INFORMATION USED FOR ADVERTISING

As discussed above, on our Websites, we may collect and disclose Personal Information about your online activities for use in providing you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. This section of our Privacy Policy provides details and explains how to exercise your choices. You may see certain ads on other websites because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and contextual means. These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs, and web beacons (also known as pixels). The networks use this information to show you advertisements that may be tailored to your individual interests. The information our ad networks may collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the relevant advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our Websites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

#### 8. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

Our Websites are not intended for children under 16 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect or sell Personal Information from children under 16. If you are under 16, do not use or provide any information on these Websites or through any of its features. If we learn we have collected or received Personal Information from a child under 16 without verification of parental consent, we will delete it. If you are the parent or guardian of a child under 16 years of age whom you believe might have provided us with their Personal Information, you may contact us using the below information to request that it be deleted.

#### 9. SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

We take steps to secure Personal Information through administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect against the risk of accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or use. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted through the Internet, and where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.

#### 10. RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

We generally retain records only as long as necessary and as required for our business operations, for archival purposes, and/or to satisfy legal requirements. When determining the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we take into account various criteria, such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information; potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure; purposes for which we process your Personal Information; whether we can achieve those purposes through other means; and business operations and legal requirements. Because we maintain our Websites to protect from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your Personal Information may be retained in our backup and archival systems for a limited period of time, after which the information will be automatically deleted or put beyond use where deletion is not possible.

#### 11. INTERNATIONAL USERS

The Websites are controlled and operated by us from the United States and are not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States. Any information you provide to us through use of our Websites may be stored and processed, transferred between and accessed from the United States and other countries that may not guarantee the same level of protection of personal data as the one in which you reside. However, we will handle your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy regardless of where your Personal Information is stored/accessed.
